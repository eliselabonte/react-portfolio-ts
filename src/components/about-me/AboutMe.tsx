            <h4>Artist, mariner, hiker, farmer, coder. Life is sometimes strange.</h4>
            <p>I left my home of Boston, MA after college to pursue a career on the waters of South East Alaska. There were bears. There were boats. Most importantly, there were Alaskans.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            After a five years of all of these things I love, I decided it was time to come home to New England and return to my first love - learning. But where to start?
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            One cross-country road trip, a summer working with farm animals, and many months of hard work (with more to come) later, I am happy to say that coding chose me.
            <br></br>
            <br></br>
            I am proud to be able to present a small but growing body of work from my studies.</p>
